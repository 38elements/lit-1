> lit-localize is a library and command-line tool for localizing/translating web
> applications that are based on lit-html and LitElement.

## Features

- üåê Localize your lit-html and LitElement applications
- üî• Safely embed HTML markup within localized templates
- üç¶ Write vanilla code that works in development with no new tooling
- üìÑ Standard XLIFF interchange format
- üÜì Generate a zero-overhead bundle for each locale
- üîÅ ... or dynamically load locales and automatically re-render

## Tutorial

1. Install lit-localize. You get both a client library and a command-line tool.
   You'll always use both together.

   ```bash
   npm install --save lit-localize
   ```

2. Set up a TypeScript lit-html project if you don't have one already:

   ```bash
   npm install --save lit-html
   npm install --save-dev typescript
   npx tsc --init
   ```

   You'll want these TypeScript settings:

   ```json
   "compilerOptions": {
     "target": "es2018",
     "module": "esnext",
     "moduleResolution": "node"
   }
   ```

   You'll also need this directory to exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir xliff
   ```

3. Create an `index.ts`, and declare a localizable template using the `msg`
   function. The first argument is a unique identifier for this template, and
   the second is a string or lit-html template.

   (Note that this code will directly compile and run, just as it would if you
   were rendering the lit template directly, so your build process doesn't need
   to change until you want to integrate localized templates.)

   ```typescript
   import {html, render} from 'lit-html';
   import {msg} from 'lit-localize';

   render(
     html`<p>${msg('greeting', html`Hello <b>World</b>!`)}</p>`,
     document.body
   );
   ```

4. Make a JSON config file at the root of your project called
   `lit-localize.json`. In this example we're using _transform_ mode, but you
   can also use _runtime_ mode. The `$schema` property is optional, and lets
   editors like VSCode auto-complete and check for errors.

   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PolymerLabs/lit-localize/master/config.schema.json",
     "sourceLocale": "en",
     "targetLocales": ["es-419"],
     "tsConfig": "tsconfig.json",
     "output": {
       "mode": "transform"
     },
     "interchange": {
       "format": "xliff",
       "xliffDir": "xliff/"
     }
   }
   ```

5. Run the lit-localize CLI:

   ```bash
   npx lit-localize
   ```

6. Take a look at the generated XLIFF file `xliff/es-419.xlf`. Note that we have
   a `<source>` template extracted from your source code, but we don't have a
   localized version yet. Also note that embedded HTML markup has been encoded
   into `<ph>` tags.

   ```xml
   <trans-unit id="greeting">
     <source>Hello <ph id="0">&lt;b></ph>World<ph id="1">&lt;/b></ph>!</source>
   </trans-unit>
   ```

7. Edit `xliff/es-419.xlf` to add a `<target>` tag containing a localized
   version of the template. Usually you would use a tool or service to generate
   this tag by feeding it this XLIFF file.

   ```xml
   <trans-unit id="greeting">
     <source>Hello <ph id="0">&lt;b></ph>World<ph id="1">&lt;/b></ph>!</source>
     <target>Hola <ph id="0">&lt;b></ph>Mundo<ph id="1">&lt;/b></ph>!</target>
   </trans-unit>
   ```

8. Run `lit-localize` again:

   ```bash
   npx lit-localize
   ```

9. Now take a look at the generated file `es-419/index.js`:

   ```javascript
   import {html, render} from 'lit-html';
   render(html`<p>Hola <b>Mundo</b>!</p>`, document.body);
   ```

   and `en/index.js`:

   ```javascript
   import {html, render} from 'lit-html';
   render(html`<p>Hello <b>World</b>!</p>`, document.body);
   ```

   Note that the localized template has been substituted into your code, the
   `msg` call has been removed, the lit-html template has been reduced to its
   simplest form, and the `lit-localize` module is no longer imported.

## API

The `lit-localize` module exports the following functions:

> Note that lit-localize relies on distinctive, annotated TypeScript type
> signatures to identify calls to `msg` and other APIs during analysis of your
> code. Casting a lit-localize function to a type that does not include its
> annotation will prevent lit-localize from being able to extract and transform
> templates from your application. For example, a cast like
> `(msg as any)("greeting", "Hello")` will not be identified. It is safe to
> re-assign lit-localize functions or pass them as parameters, as long as the
> distinctive type signature is preserved. If needed, you can reference each
> function's distinctive type with e.g. `typeof msg`.

### `configureLocalization(configuration)`

Set configuration parameters for lit-localize when in runtime mode. Returns an
object with functions:

- [`getLocale`](#getlocale-string): Return the active locale code.
- [`setLocale`](#setlocalelocale-string-promise): Set the active locale code.

Throws if called more than once.

When in transform mode, the lit-localize CLI will error if this function is
called. Use
[`configureTransformLocalization`](#configuretransformlocalizationconfiguration)
instead.

The `configuration` object must have the following properties:

- `sourceLocale: string`: Required locale code in which source templates in this
  project are written, and the initial active locale.

- `targetLocales: Iterable<string>`: Required locale codes that are supported by
  this project. Should not include the `sourceLocale` code.

- `loadLocale: (locale: string) => Promise<LocaleModule>`: Required function
  that returns a promise of the localized templates for the given locale code.
  For security, this function will only ever be called with a `locale` that is
  contained by `targetLocales`.

Example:

```typescript
const {getLocale, setLocale} = configureLocalization({
  sourceLocale: 'en',
  targetLocales: ['es-419', 'zh_CN'],
  loadLocale: (locale) => import(`/${locale}.js`),
});
```

### `configureTransformLocalization(configuration)`

Set configuration parameters for lit-localize when in transform mode. Returns an
object with function:

- [`getLocale`](#getlocale-string): Return the active locale code.

(Note that [`setLocale`](#setlocalelocale-string-promise) is not available from
this function, because changing locales at runtime is not supported in transform
mode.)

Throws if called more than once.

The `configuration` object must have the following properties:

- `sourceLocale: string`: Required locale code in which source templates in this
  project are written, and the active locale.

Example:

```typescript
const {getLocale} = configureLocalization({
  sourceLocale: 'en',
});
```

In transform mode, calls to this function are transformed to an object with a
`getLocale` implementation that returns the static locale code for each locale
bundle. For example:

```typescript
const {getLocale} = {getLocale: () => 'es-419'};
```

### `getLocale() => string`

Return the active locale code.

### `setLocale(locale: string) => Promise`

Set the active locale code, and begin loading templates for that locale using
the `loadLocale` function that was passed to `configureLocalization`. Returns a
promise that resolves when the next locale is ready to be rendered.

Note that if a second call to `setLocale` is made while the first requested
locale is still loading, then the second call takes precedence, and the promise
returned from the first call will resolve when second locale is ready. If you
need to know whether a particular locale was loaded, check `getLocale` after the
promise resolves.

Throws if the given locale is not contained by the configured `sourceLocale` or
`targetLocales`.

### `msg(id: string, template, ...args) => string|TemplateResult`

Make a string or lit-html template localizable.

The `id` parameter is a project-wide unique identifier for this template.

The `template` parameter can have any of these types:

- A plain string with no placeholders:

  ```typescript
  msg('greeting', 'Hello World!');
  ```

- A lit-html
  [`TemplateResult`](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/api/classes/_lit_html_.templateresult.html)
  that may contain embedded HTML:

  ```typescript
  msg('greeting', html`Hello <b>World</b>!`);
  ```

- A function that returns a [template
  literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
  string that may contain placeholders. Placeholders may only reference
  parameters of the function, which will be called with the 3rd and onwards
  parameters to `msg`.

  ```typescript
  msg('greeting', (name) => `Hello ${name}!`, getUsername());
  ```

- A function that returns a lit-html
  [`TemplateResult`](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/api/classes/_lit_html_.templateresult.html)
  that may contain embedded HTML, and may contain placeholders. Placeholders may
  only reference parameters of the function, which will be called with the 3rd
  and onwards parameters to `msg`:

  ```typescript
  msg('greeting', (name) => html`Hello <b>${name}</b>!`, getUsername());
  ```

In transform mode, calls to this function are replaced with the static localized
template for each emitted locale. For example:

```typescript
html`Hola <b>${getUsername()}!</b>`;
```

### `LOCALE_STATUS_EVENT`

Name of the [`lit-localize-status` event](#lit-localize-status-event).

## `lit-localize-status` event

In runtime mode, whenever a locale change starts, finishes successfully, or
fails, lit-localize will dispatch a `lit-localize-status` event to `window`.

You can listen for this event to know when your application should be
re-rendered following a locale change. See also the
[`Localized`](#localized-mixin) mixin, which automatically re-renders
`LitElement` classes using this event.

### Event types

The `detail.status` string property tells you what kind of status change has occured,
and can be one of: `loading`, `ready`, or `error`:

#### `loading`

A new locale has started to load. The `detail` object also contains:

- `loadingLocale: string`: Code of the locale that has started loading.

A `loading` status can be followed by a `ready`, `error`, or `loading` status.

In the case that a second locale is requested before the first one finishes
loading, a new `loading` event is dispatched, and no `ready` or `error` event
will be dispatched for the first request, because it is now stale.

#### `ready`

A new locale has successfully loaded and is ready for rendering. The `detail` object also contains:

- `readyLocale: string`: Code of the locale that has successfully loaded.

A `ready` status can be followed only by a `loading` status.

#### `error`

A new locale failed to load. The `detail` object also contains the following
properties:

- `errorLocale: string`: Code of the locale that failed to load.
- `errorMessage: string`: Error message from locale load failure.

An `error` status can be followed only by a `loading` status.

### Event example

```typescript
// Show/hide a progress indicator whenever a new locale is loading,
// and re-render the application every time a new locale successfully loads.
window.addEventListener('lit-localize-status', (event) => {
  const spinner = document.querySelector('#spinner');
  if (event.detail.status === 'loading') {
    console.log(`Loading new locale: ${event.detail.loadingLocale}`);
    spinner.removeAttribute('hidden');
  } else if (event.detail.status === 'ready') {
    console.log(`Loaded new locale: ${event.detail.readyLocale}`);
    spinner.addAttribute('hidden');
    renderApplication();
  } else if (event.detail.status === 'error') {
    console.error(
      `Error loading locale ${event.detail.errorLocale}: ` +
        event.detail.errorMessage
    );
    spinner.addAttribute('hidden');
  }
});
```

## `Localized` mixin

If you are using [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), then
you can use the `Localized`
[mixin](https://justinfagnani.com/2015/12/21/real-mixins-with-javascript-classes/)
from `lit-localize/localized-element.js` to ensure that your elements
automatically re-render whenever the locale changes.

```typescript
import {Localized} from 'lit-localize/localized-element.js';
import {msg} from 'lit-localize';
import {LitElement, html} from 'lit-element';

class MyElement extends Localized(LitElement) {
  render() {
    // Whenever setLocale() is called, and templates for that locale have
    // finished loading, this render() function will be re-invoked.
    return html`<p>
      ${msg('greeting', html`Hello <b>World!</b>`)}
    </p>`;
  }
}
```

In transform mode, applications of the `Localized` mixin are removed.
